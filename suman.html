Wait! Just because it's your birthday, don't think that I am going to write 
only the good things about you...be ready for what's coming!</p>

<p>Remember how you were in school and college? 

In school, you were this pony-tailed girl who 'no one wanted to mess with
You were studious and smart but then you'd get irritated and snap out soon 
saying what you felt on the face (no sugar coating) 
but for some reason, you were always nice to me.

In college, you were this diva - long straight hair and all remember?
The CR, fav of all teachers, and the university topper! </p>
<p>
But these were all surface-level descriptions, 
I got to know about the 'real you' after college.
<ul>
<li> I got to know about this free-spirited girl who had big dreams and was willing to work hard for it.
<li> I got to know how you wanted to be everything to your parents and brother - the caring daughter, the eldest daughter and the caring sister.
<li> I got to know about this little girl inside you, who above everything wanted to be just loved by people around her.
</ul> </p>
<p>
Over the years, you have become the strong person that everyone around you 
can count on. After my mother, you are the strongest woman I know 
and I am so proud of the fact that I get to call you my friend:)

Life has not been very kind to you but the way you rise every single time 
and the way you live life is something I truly admire and I mean it!

You did not have to, but you proved yourself 'CA Shweta Gupta'
I hope this year and all the years ahead are the best ones of your life. 
You deserve everything good.
