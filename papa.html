    <p id="head">Happy Birthday!</p>
    <p>Happy 31th Birthday, Shweta!Today, we celebrate not only the incredible milestone of your 31th year but also the remarkable person you’ve become. As a dedicated Chartered Accountant, your hard work and perseverance inspire everyone around you, but it’s your kindness, warmth, and resilience that truly make you shine. As you step into this exciting new chapter, may life bring you boundless joy, success, and all the adventures you dream of. Always remember how deeply you’re loved and cherished.
Have an amazing birthday, Shweta! The best is yet to come, and we can’t wait to see all the incredible things you’ll achieve. When I became a graduate, I dreamt of becoming a chartered accountant, but couldn't do so because of my ill health. But when you became a CA , it was a dream come true for me. I am really really very proud of you.
</p>
<p>With all my love,Bijay Kumar Gupta</p>
