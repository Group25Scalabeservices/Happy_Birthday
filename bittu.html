    <p id="head">Dear Didi</p>
    <p>I just want to say how deeply grateful I am to have you in my life. Thank you for always being my rock, standing by me no matter what, and loving me unconditionally. You mean the world to me, and I can’t bear to see you unhappy.
 
Yes, there are times when I get angry or raise my voice, but please know that no amount of frustration could ever diminish the bond we share. I will always care for you, Didi, more than words can express.
 
One thing I truly wish for you is to prioritize yourself sometimes. Stop worrying about everyone else and take a moment to just live for yourself—you deserve it.
 
I hope you like the gift and have a wonderful birthday. Take care of yourself always. I love you so much, Didi.</p>
